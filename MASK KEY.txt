Layer 1: Floor
Layer 2: Walls
Layer 3: Enemies
Layer 9: Probably for music idrk
Layer 10: The Player (projectile -> player)

All floors should have their layer and mask set to 1.
All walls should have their layer set to 2, and their mask set to 1.
All enemies should have their collision mask set to 10, and collision layer set to 16.

Non-collidable entities (arena spawners etc.) should have their LAYER set to 5, and their MASK set to 10.
This way, the MASK can detect the player, and the player will not be obstructed by the collision shape 2D.
